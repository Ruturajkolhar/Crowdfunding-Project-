 Worked on a real world data of an online crowdfunding platform and provided data driven insights through interactive dashboards created using Excel, Tableau, Power BI, & SQL queries, based on client needs & KPI'S requirements which helped the platform administrators to monitor the  performance of multiple campaigns on their platform.

 A marketing team of a crowdfunding platfrom needed insights about the performance of the platform  and also the stratigies to improve the performance of the platform, so we solved their buisness problem by assisting the key audience of the platform to moniter the performance and we also provided the stratigies to improve the platform.

### Transformations
##### we made a study on the provided dataset and performed some data transformation like: 

> Removing errors

> Converting epoch time columns to 
   local time 

> Creating calendar table on created_at column which includes,year, Quarter, month,month  no, financial month,financial quarter etc.

> Converting goal amount to USD 

> And finally modelling the data by establishing relationship.
  
> Evaluated the data,created insights, Discussed the purpose and goals of the dashboard defined the key mertics and information that needed, implemented the visuals 
collaborating with team members resulting in improving efficiency and productivity and provided the solution by creating dashboard.

### Insights
##### In dashboard we provided them the performace of the platform like:

> The No of projects were increasing year by year

> The Top successful project by No of backers and amount raised.

> The Top contributing countries in the project based on no of backers, no of projects, and amount raised.

#### And we also finded some insights which were affecting the functionality of the platform like:

> The engagement of the backers in the project was less due to not giving of good rewards.

> Also the engagemant on the platform was less due to not creating of the campagins.

> Most of the project failed due not effective funding stratigies.

### Suggessions
##### So by taking all this factor into account we developed some stratigies and presented it like:

> we suggested them to improve marketing stratigies

> Create campaging for the engagement on the platform

> And provide good rewards which will attract the backers leading to increase in participation in the project

> Develop Effective Funding stratigies

> Keep backers always engage.
> 

### Result:

> So by applying of all these stratigies there was improvisation on the platform.
